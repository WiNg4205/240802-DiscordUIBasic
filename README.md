# 04/08/24 - DiscordUIBasic (#9)
This is a basic Discord UI with the server sidebar and the server name shown on the channels bar.

I am getting slightly more familiar with using tailwind. I used a lot of the tailwind features for this project so the next time, I will know what to look for in the documentation when building tailwind apps. For this week, I will try to do more social media UI's to get more familiar with tailwind and website UI's in general.
